**This repo is currently in a beta state. Use at your own risk**

The OWASP Amass Project performs network mapping of attack surfaces and external asset discovery using open source information gathering and active reconnaissance techniques.

## Docker Compose Setup Instructions

### Install the Compose Directory

1. Be sure you have an up-to-date version of Docker or Docker Desktop on your system.
2. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/owasp-amass/amass-docker-compose.git`
3. Optional: you may want to rename the directory to something smaller (e.g. `amass`)
4. Make the local repo your current working directory: `cd amass-docker-compose`

### Configure the Compose Environment

1. Recommended: open the `config/assetdb.env` file and assign a new POSTGRES_PASSWORD and AMASS_PASSWORD. Save. **This cannot be performed after you start the Docker Compose and the database has been created.**
2. Make desired changes to the `config.yaml` file, being sure to replace the password field of the `database` value with the password you assigned as your AMASS_PASSWORD. Save.
3. Optional: update your `datasources.yaml` file by uncommenting data sources and adding account credentials.

### Build the Docker Images

1. Your Amass framework is now configured and ready to be built. Docker Compose will build the required images and start them correctly when you perform your first `amass` command execution.
2. Type the following to get started: `docker compose run --rm amass enum -d owasp.org`
3. If the build process times out, simply execute the command again to resume.

### Details about the Docker Environment

* All persistent data used exists on your host in the local repo root directory.
* The `assetdb` is a [PostgreSQL](https://github.com/postgres/postgres) database reachable from your localhost on port 5432.
* Config files in the local repo are automatically mapped to where components expect to find them in the Docker environment.
* Interact with the framework using the client program: `docker compose run --rm amass enum -d owasp.org`
* You can obtain information about your asset discoveries by accessing the web UI at the following URL: `http://127.0.0.1:3000`

### Update Process for the Compose Environment

1. Make the local repo your current working directory: `cd amass-docker-compose`
2. Shutdown the Amass framework within the Docker environment: `docker compose down`
3. Backup the `config/assetdb.env`, `config/config.yaml`, and `config/datasources.yaml` files.
4. Backup the following directories: `assetdb`, `data`, and `logs`
5. Update the compose local repo with the following command: `git pull origin master`
6. Restore the files and directories backed up in Steps 3 and 4.

### Update Process for the Images

1. Make the local repo your current working directory: `cd amass-docker-compose`
2. Shutdown the Amass framework within the Docker environment: `docker compose down`
3. Update components from their GitHub repos: `docker compose build --pull --no-cache`
4. Your Amass framework is now up-to-date with the latest changes to the project.

## Testimonials

### [![Accenture Logo](https://github.com/owasp-amass/amass/blob/master/images/accenture_logo.png) Accenture](https://www.accenture.com/)

*"Accenture’s adversary simulation team has used Amass as our primary tool suite on a variety of external enumeration projects and attack surface assessments for clients. It’s been an absolutely invaluable basis for infrastructure enumeration, and we’re really grateful for all the hard work that’s gone into making and maintaining it – it’s made our job much easier!"*

\- Max Deighton, Accenture Cyber Defense Manager

### [![Visma Logo](https://github.com/owasp-amass/amass/blob/master/images/visma_logo.png) Visma](https://www.visma.com/)

*"For an internal red team, the organisational structure of Visma puts us against a unique challenge. Having sufficient, continuous visibility over our external attack surface is an integral part of being able to efficiently carry out our task. When dealing with hundreds of companies with different products and supporting infrastructure we need to always be on top of our game.*

*For years, OWASP Amass has been a staple in the asset reconnaissance field, and keeps proving its worth time after time. The tool keeps constantly evolving and improving to adapt to the new trends in this area."*
